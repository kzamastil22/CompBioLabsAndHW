Spring 21' 

This is where I as a student at the University of Colorado Boulder intend to 
store the contents of my computational biology course submissions. There will 
be a range of lab work that accesses varying data sets for its results. The 
assignments range from pushing cookie recipes, computing plots, to 
creating solutions for real world issues with features on R.
